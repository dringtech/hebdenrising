This site shows how much of Hebden Bridge is open for business.
The boxing day floods were devastating for the entire town, but the
resilience of the locals and community spirit have helped to amazing things
in a really short space of time.

Businesses, however, need to be renovated properly, and may take some time to
get back into operation. The [map](/) and [list](/shops/) will help you find
out when they are.

The data has been collected by [@cakebikecake](https://twitter.com/cakebikecake)
and [@gilesdring](https://twitter.com/gilesdring). We know we may not
have done a perfect job, and businesses are re-opening all the time. Please
[let us know](/feedback/) if we've missed a business out, or if there's an
update, and we'll
correct the site as soon as possible.
